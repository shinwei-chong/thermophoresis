% SUMAMARY: script file to perform normalisation of pixel intensity with
% respect to reference image

% WORKFLOW:
% 1) image correction so that the sum of pixel intensity is the same across
% each image (account for decreasing brightness due to photobleaching)
% 2) normalise pixel intensity of image relative to reference image (t=0)
% 3) compute average intensity of each column 
% 4) plot the intensity profile for each image 

% REQUIRED USER INPUT:
% - image folder name 
% - image crop size
